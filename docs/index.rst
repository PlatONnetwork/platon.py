Introduction
============

platon.py is a Python library for interacting with Platon.

It's commonly found in `decentralized apps (dapps)`_ to help with
sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, reading
block data, and a variety of other use cases.

The original API was derived from the `Web3.js`_ Javascript API,
but has since evolved toward the needs and creature comforts of
Python developers.
