# Overview

These `pytest-platon` tools include a few utilities to simplify handling PlatonPM packages. Specifically, deploying and linking contracts that are contained within an PlatonPM package. When the `py-platonpm` codebase was [ported](https://github.com/platonnetwork/platon.py/pull/1379) into `web3` to remove a circular dependency between `platonpm` & `web3`, these utilities were simultaneously ported over from [pytest-platon](https://github.com/platonnetwork/pytest-platon), to avoid a similar circular dependency.

Complete documentation for how to use these utilities can be found on the [pytest-platon docs](https://pytest-platon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html).
